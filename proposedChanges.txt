Below are the following proposed changes for Sarah's simulatorRepo from Will Dunn:
-account for arguments that are 0 and above, instead of 1+.
-move functions specific to the grocery or bank into their own classes.
-move .hpp includes into the .cpp because they are split amongst both right now
-small formatting changes to adhere to clion style guide
-alteration to variable names to fit Google C++ style guide
-removed redundant castings (I.e., function returns double and double  variable is 
cast to double before return)
-alteration of variable names add clarity
-removal of unused variables
